# MST
Minimum weight spanning tree

Description:

This program computes a minimum-weight spanning tree (MST) for n points. The program can successfully read in an input file that describes NUM PT(number of points) in a two-dimensional plane, within the rectangular area [0, MAX X] Ã— [0, MAX Y]. The program expects to read in a file that has its first two sets of numbers that are MAX X and a MAX Y, which essentially is the boundaries of the values to be read. The second integer the program expects to read is the total number of points that exists on the two-dimensional plane. The rest of the numbers that the program reads should be the points themselves. 

The program will also create instances if it is not fed with a file.

*The program also checks for file correctness.
